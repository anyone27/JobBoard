# Jobs Board

### This is a work in progress and currently not a live site. Once the core features are implemented I will be hosting this and making it live.

The idea for this web app is to create a jobs board that puts the applicant first.

It will be compulsory for the employer to provide a starting salary or salary range on every job post and the search functionality should only allow for relevent results and accurate filtering to avoid wasting the employer and applicants time during their search.

The current/intended features of this site include:

- [x] Register user
- [x] Login/Logout
- [/] User Authentication with cookies and authentication tokens (WIP)
- [x] Create Company
- [x] Post Vacancy
- [/] Apply for Vacancy (WIP)
- [ ] Jobs Searching (TODO)
- [ ] Job filtering (TODO)
- [/] User Profile (WIP)
- [/] User CV upload/fetch (WIP)
- [x] SQL Database to store and query all relevant data and relationships
- [/] Dashboard (WIP)
  - [x] Display all jobs posted by a user
  - [x] Applied to by a user
  - [] All applications/Applicants for a posted role (TODO)
  - [ ] All companies associated with a user (TODO)
  - [ ] Status of all job applications (TODO)
- [ ] Communication relating to job applications (TODO)
